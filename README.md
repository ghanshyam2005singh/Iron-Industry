## 🌟 Current Focus: [AlumConnect](https://github.com/IronIndustry/AlumConnect)

AlumConnect is our first flagship product — a secure, verified platform to connect college students and alumni.  
It’s built for mentorship, guidance, and growth, starting with real use cases from Indian campuses.


## 🔍 Vision

- Build strong, scalable, and secure digital products under a unified ecosystem.
- Foster a passionate open-source community through [DevRhylme Foundation](https://github.com/DEVRhylme-Foundation).
- Empower developers, students, and communities — especially from underrepresented and rural regions.
